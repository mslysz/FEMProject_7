## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS preprocessor
- BEM methodology
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice building JSX structure in React. I utilized React hooks such as useState and useEffect. Additionally, I practiced importing data from objects in the data.js file, which were then used in my components.
When developing this project, I suggest focusing on the implementation of the slider logic, which is the most important part of this project.
